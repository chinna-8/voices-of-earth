      <li><strong>Use Renewable Energy:</strong> Support and switch to renewable energy sources like solar or wind power for your home or business.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Public Transportation:</strong> Reduce your personal carbon footprint by using public transportation, carpooling, or biking instead of driving alone.</li>
